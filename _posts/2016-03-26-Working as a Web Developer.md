# I’m a Web Developer!

About a week ago I had a chance to go and visit my dad at his new company, Gowani Pump Supply. I spend the whole day there mainly just sitting around, as there was nothing there for me to do.

After I got home, I had some time to think about his new business and realized that I could help him reach more audience by getting ‘Gowani Pump Supply’ a presence on the glorious internet.


I shared this idea of mine with him and he agreed!

I am no experienced web developer, but I dived into it hoping to learn as time passed on.

Step one would’ve been to make a functional website on the computer before hosting it online. Although I was aware of the step, I skipped it. I was too excited to own a domain name and hoped that having a running website domain would motivated me to work faster on building the website. Once I had purchased a domain and had a domain hosting site, I went on to create a temporary page that provided the viewer with basic information such as the name of the company and contact information and ended with “Website Under Construction.”
