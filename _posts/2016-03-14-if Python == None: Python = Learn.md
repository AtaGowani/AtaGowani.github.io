# Python

I have embarked on a journey of learning Python and HTML/CSS. This post will be focused on my journey towards Python. Before I get into more details on Python, I would like to take a moment and apologize if the title of my post was confusing. The title was an **attempt** at mimicking the coding language of Python. If you understood the title CONGRATS YOU’RE A NERD!

Let me just start with a brief background on Python. Python is a programming language that was conceived in the late 1980s. This language was created by Guido van Rossum. It is an open source programming language that was made to look good and also be easy to read.


I am taking a beginner’s course in Python on Coursera. This course is taught by Dr. Chuck of the University of Michigan. I am in the last week of the beginner’s course and after that will be moving on to take further courses by Dr. Chuck as a continuation of this one.

As someone who is interested in Computer Engineering, I believe that it is important for me to introduce myself to programming languages. I have chosen to start with Python and will continue to explore other languages.
