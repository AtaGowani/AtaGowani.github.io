# What is EPICS?

This semester, I have decided to take part in EPICS (**E**ngineering **P**rojects **I**n **C**ommunity **S**ervice) and work toward solving a real-life engineering problem using The Engineering Design Process.

## But What EXACTLY is EPICS?

EPICS is essentially set up like a class, but the learning does not take place in the classical way where you sit and take notes for about one and a half hours. Instead, students are presented with different non-profit organizations that are dealing with interdisciplinary engineering problems, ranging from mechanical to electrical to software. Students then have the chance to choose which non-profit organization they would like to partner with. After they have made this decision, they are put into teams of four to five students who chose the same organization. 

# My Project

The voting process described above took place last week, and I ended up being assigned to my first choice organization, <a href="https://www.intellichoice.org/">IntelliChoice, Inc.</a>

## IntelliChoice?

IntelliChoice, Inc. is a non-profit organization based in Dallas, Texas. The organization “…seeks to develop an interest in mathematics, increase college readiness, and promote a successful future career for kindergarten to 12th grade children who lack the educational opportunities and resources.”

## The Engineering Problem? Well...

IntelliChoice, Inc. has limited web support and needs the development of a database for efficient management. Additionally, they want to develop an online class to provide free math tutoring to students in remote areas where educational resources are very limited.

Now, it’s up to our team to solve this specific engineering problem over the duration of this semester.
